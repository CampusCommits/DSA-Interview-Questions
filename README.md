# DSA Interview Questions

## Overview
Welcome to the **DSA Interview Questions** repository! This project is a collaborative effort to compile a comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions commonly asked in technical interviews. The repository is open to contributions from students and group mates to help everyone prepare effectively for coding interviews.

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to:
- Provide a centralized resource for DSA interview questions.
- Encourage collaborative learning by allowing students to contribute questions, solutions, and explanations.
- Cover a wide range of topics, including arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
- Include clear problem statements, solutions, and explanations to aid understanding.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from everyone! Follow these steps to add your DSA questions or solutions:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of this page to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA-interview-questions.git
   ```
3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a branch for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-new-question
   ```
4. **Add Your Question**:
   - Navigate to the appropriate topic folder (e.g., `arrays`, `linked-lists`, `graphs`).
   - If the topic folder doesn't exist, create one (e.g., `mkdir dynamic-programming`).
   - Add your question in a new file named descriptively (e.g., `two-sum.md`).
   - Use the template below for consistency.
5. **Commit Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [question-name] question and solution"
   ```
6. **Push to Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin add-new-question
   ```
7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and submit a pull request. Provide a clear description of your contribution.

### Contribution Guidelines
- Ensure your question is relevant to DSA and commonly asked in interviews.
- Follow the provided question template (see below).
- Include a clear problem statement, solution (in at least one programming language), and explanation.
- Avoid duplicating existing questions. Check the repository before adding.
- Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
- Be respectful and collaborative in all interactions.

## Question Template
Use the following template for each question file:

```markdown
# [Question Name]

## Problem Statement
[Describe the problem clearly and concisely. Include input/output formats and constraints.]

## Example
[Provide one or more examples to illustrate the problem.]

**Input**: [Example input]
**Output**: [Example output]

## Solution
[Provide a solution in at least one programming language. Include comments for clarity.]

```[language]
[Your code here]
```

## Explanation
[Explain the approach, time complexity, and space complexity of the solution.]

## Tags
[List relevant topics, e.g., Array, Two-Pointers, Dynamic Programming]
```
